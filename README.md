Parachute - Paragraph style standard for Indesign
#### Description
Parachute is a paragraph style standard for indesign CC 2015+. It was created to help improve how designers use paragraph styles in indesign.
#### Mission
Parachute aims to create a standard in which any designer can edit and format a document and then be able to give it do someone else. Paragraph styles in indesign is a tool meant to make everyones life easier. The more I've worked in the graphic design industry, the more I relized that because there isn't a standard in which to create styles, most designers become confused by them and stear away from them, or worse not use them correctly. By creating a style standard any designer can open up a indesign document, look at the paragraph style panel and know excately what's happening in a document.
